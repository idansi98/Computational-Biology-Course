# CB Homework #3

In this HW we create a genetic algorithm that generates classifier neural networks.

## Setup

Make sure the folder has the following files:
* runnet.py
* testnet0.txt which corresponds to the pattern in nn0.txt
* testnet1.txt which corresponds to the pattern in nn1.txt
* wnet0
* wnet1

## Running
1. Open the CLI and type `python .\runnet.py`
2. The program will generate prediction0.txt and prediction1.txt which correspond to the predicted label of testnet0.txt and testnet1.txt
